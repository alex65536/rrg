//! Utilities for working with sessions.
//!
//! Sessions are created per action request and should be used as the only way
//! to communicate with the server. Sessions are responsible for handling action
//! errors (when something goes wrong) or notifying the server that the action
//! finished (by sending appropriate status signal).
//!
//! They also keep track of various statistics (such as number of transferred
//! bytes, action runtime, etc.) and stop the execution if they exceed limits
//! for a particular request.
